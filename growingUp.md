# Growing Up
I was born in Georgia but only lived there for a few months as my family was moving around quite a bit at that time. We moved to Nashville Tennesse, where my sister was born, then we moved to Indiana and we finally ended up in Columbia where I have lived for the past 10 years. I've spent most of my life living in Columbia and don't remember much from the other places so I would consider myself from Missouri.
